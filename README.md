# Invertible Gaussian Reparameterization: Revisting the Gumbel-Softmax

This repo contains a TensorFlow 2.0 implementation of the Invertible Gaussian Reparameterization.

<br>**Abstract**<br>
*The Gumbel-Softmax is a continuous distribution over the simplex that is often used as a relaxation of discrete
distributions. Because it can be readily interpreted and easily reparameterized, it enjoys widespread use. Unfortunately, we
show that the cost of this aesthetic interpretability is material: the temperature hyperparameter must be set too high, KL
estimates are noisy, and as a result, performance suffers. We circumvent the previous issues by proposing a much simpler and
more flexible reparameterizable family of distributions that transforms Gaussian noise into a one-hot approximation through an
invertible function. This invertible function is composed of a modified softmax and can incorporate diverse transformations
that serve different specific purposes. For example, the stick-breaking procedure allows us to extend the reparameterization
trick to distributions with countably infinite support, or normalizing flows let us increase the flexibility of the
distribution. Our construction improves numerical stability and outperforms the Gumbel-Softmax in a variety of experiments
while generating samples that are closer to their discrete counterparts and achieving lower-variance gradients.*

## Overview
The goal of this documentation is to clarify the structure of the repo and to provide a guide to replicate the
results from the paper. To avoid reading all details, I recommend that you find the files that are linked to
the experiment that you want to run (see Replicating Figures / Tables section) and only then check the
information about the folder of interest in the (General Information section).

### Requirements
Briefly, the requirements for the project are Python >= 3.6 (since we use printing syntax only available after
3.6) and to pip install the the packages needed (which will fetch all the dependencies as well). Make sure
that you have the latest `pip` version (else it will not find TensorFlow 2).  This repo was develop using
TensorFlow 2.0.1, but it runs for 2.1.0 as well. The only package that requires a specific version is
TensorFlow Datasets 1.3.0 since the features in CelebA changed. Moreover, we also added a Singularity
definition file `igr_singularity.def` if you want to create an image to run the project in a HPC cluster (it
will only require that the host has the 10.0 CUDA drivers available). In summary you could run the following
in you terminal to ensure that the installation works (after adding the repo to your `$PYTHONPATH`)
```
python3 -m pip install --update pip
python3 -m pip install -r requirements.txt
cd ./igr/
mkdir Log
python3 vae_experiments/mnist_vae.py
```
from wherever you cloned the repo. It should successfully run an experiment with an small sample that should
take 5 - 10 seconds.

## General Information

### Structure of the Repository

* `Log`: is the directory where the outputs from the experiments are logged and saved (weights of the NNs).
  The contents of this directory are disposable, move the results that you want to save into the
  `Results` directory for further analysis (see below).
* `Models`: contains the training functions (`train_vae.py`, `SOPOptimizer,py`), the optimizer classes
(`OptVAE`, `SOPOptimizer`), and the neural network architectures (`VAENet.py` `SOP.py`)
for both the VAE and for the SOP experiments.
* `Results`: this directory serves two purposes. First, it holds all the figures created by the scripts in the
  repo and then it contains the outputs from the experiments that are used as input for some figures /
  tables.
* `Tests`: contains various tests for relevant classes in the repo. The name indicates which class is being tested.
* `Utils`: has key functions / classes used throughout the repo: `Distributions.py` contains the GS and
  IGR samplers, `MinimizeEmpiricalLoss.py` contains the optimizer class for learning the parameters that
  approximate a discrete distribution, `general.py` contains the functions used for approximating discrete
  distributions, for evaluating simplex proximity and for initializing the distribution's parameters,
  `load_data.py` contains all the utils needed to load the data, `posterior_sampling_funcs.py`, contains the
  functions to sample from the posterior distribution and `viz_vae.py` contains the functions to
  plot the performance over time.
* `approximations`: contains all the scripts to approximate discrete distributions and to learn the IGR
  priors (more details in the Replicating section).
* `vae_experiments`: contains all the scripts to run the VAE experiments to
replicate the paper results (more details in the Replicating section).
* `structure_output_prediction`: contains all the scripts to run the SOP experiments (more details in the Replicating section).

### Variables Explanation
All the scripts and saving references assume that you are running the files from the root folder of the repo
(as in the first test to check that the installation was correct). In other words, from the terminal run the
scripts as
```
python3 path/to/script.py
```
or set your IDE to run files from the root location. Throughout the code, the discrete tensors have the
following shape `(batch_n, categories_n, sample_size, num_of_vars)`. Where `batch_n` is the batch size used at
each iteration (selected by the user), `categories_n` is the dimension of each of the discrete variables,
`sample_size` is the number of samples taken during the reparameterization trick and `num_of_vars` the number
of discrete variables that the model has. Finally, below is a list that expands on the name of variables and
hyperparameters that appear frequently in different experiment scripts.

## Replicating Figures / Tables
Below is a description of how to replicate each of the Figures and Tables in the paper. The instructions
assume that no previous result has been saved, however, the repo contains the weights and log files needed to
replicate each Figure and Table so that you can run the scripts that require an input.

### Figure 1
* Input: None
* Files involved: `approximations/simplex_proximity.py`
Run as is and you will get the boxplot for the GS. If you want to get the graph for the IGR presented in the
appendix then uncomment the code that has IGR as model option (but you will need to get the prior values from
`approximations/set_prior.py` (read below).

### Figure 2
* Input: None.
* Files involved: `approximations/discrete_dist_approximation_gs.py`, `approximations/set_prior.py`
For the GS plot, run the `approximations/discrete_dist_approximation_gs.py` as is. If you want to run any of
the other plots in the appendix make the variable `selected_case` be equal to the case you want. For the IGR,
run `approximations/set_prior.py` as is. If you want to run other cases modify the  `model_type` variable
and the `run_against` variable accordingly. Note that the role of the delta parameter (from the softmax++) is
crucial for learning the last category properly. If set too low, you are virtually eliminating the last
category (you can modify the value of this parameter in `Utils/Distributions.py`). For both cases the
sampling is the most expensive computation. To accelerate this, run less samples by moving `samples_plot_n`.

### Figure 3
* Input: Multiple runs from the models saved at the specified location in the `Results` dictionary (read below).
* Files involved: `vae_experiments/viz_results.py`, `vae_experiments/discrete_grid.py`
This figure requires two steps. First to run all the experiments that you want to plot and then to run the
plotting script. For the first step select in `vae_experiments/discrete_grid.py` the model cases, datasets
and hyperparameters that you wish to run (see the Conventions section). Then move the `loss*.log`s files to the
`Results` directory. Place the results in the specified `path` on the `vae_experiments/viz_results.py` script
with ending specified by the `model` string. For example, if you ran then `IGR-I` model 5 times on MNIST and
you wish to plot the results, then place the 5 loss logs into the directory `./Results/elbo/mnist/igr_i_20`
and only run case 6, comment out the others. Hence, the location where the files are searched are a
combination of `Results/<path>/<models['model']>`. The `_20` ending refers to the temperature value that makes
75% of the posterior samples be in a disctance of 0.2 to the simplex vertex, while the `_cv` ending to the
temperature values choosen by Cross Validation.

### Table 1
* Input: The prior parameters for the IGR-SB (`approximations/set_prior.py`).
* Files involved: `vae_experiments/discrete_grid.py`, `approximations/set_prior.py`
Select the temp, for the model case and dataset that you wish to run. After testing the run set
`run_with_sample=False` and the `num_of_repetitions=5`. The hyperparameters used for the Table are the ones
present in the script. Also note that for MNIST and FMNIST I used the IGR-SB finite variant since I wanted to
specify directly 10 categories but for CelebA I specified `49` categories as maximum and let the model figure
out how many to use.

### Figure 4
* Input: Running the models and temps specified in the plot's caption.
* Files involved: `vae_experiments/viz_grad_results.py`, `vae_experiments/discrete_grid.py`,
  `Models/train_vae.py`
Before running any models ensure that the default value of `monitor_gradients` is set to `True` in the
`train_vae()` function located in the `train_vae.py` file. Then, run each of the models separately from the
`vae_experiments/discrete_grid.py` file. Once you run a model, move the last `gradients_*.pkl` file to the
specified directory in `./Results`, as in Figure 3. For example, if you run the IGR-Planar with its CV temp on
MNIST for 100 epochs, then place the `Results/gradients_100.pkl` file in the `Results/grads/igr_planar_cv/`
directory and then run `vae_experiments/viz_grad_results.py` only leaving uncommented case 1. The manual
moving of files is done to avoid overwritting files by mistake.

### Figure 5
* Input: The learnt weights of the NNs for each model and the hyper dict used at that run.
* Files involved: `vae_experiments/viz_grad_results.py`, `vae_experiments/discrete_grid.py`,
  `vae_experiments/jv_grid.py`
Once you run a model from either `vae_experiments/discrete_grid.py` or `vae_experiments/jv_grid.py` then move
the `hyper.pkl` and the last `vae_*.h5` file to the appropriate location in the `Results` directory (similar
to Figure 3 and 4). For example, if you run the IGR-SB with the low temperature in MNIST, then place the files
mentioned before in `./Results/posterior_samples/mnist/igr_sb_20`. After that run the script
`vae_experiments/posterior_samples.py` with only model 4 uncommented.

### Table 2
* Input: None.
* Files involved: `vae_experiments/jv_grid.py`
Similar to Table 1 but only now running the script in `vae_experiments/jv_grid.py`

### Table 3
* Input: None.
* Files involved: `structure_output_prediction/sop.py`
Run the script in `structure_output_prediction/sop.py` by specifying the model in `model_type`. Ensure that
the temperature value is the correct one.

## Discussion

### Implementation Nuances

The IGR-SB extends the reparameterization trick to distributions with an countably infinite
support. However, to implement the IGR-SB with finite resources, there is a threshold imposed on the
stick breaking procedure that determines a finite number of categories that are needed for a proper
estimation. Additionally, the number of categories has a maximum that is set as a
reference (this is called `latent_discrete_n` in the `hyper` dictionary). This maximum can be moved
accordingly to fit the problem. For example, for CelebA we set a maximum number of categories to 50
but the thresholding procedure ended up selecting 20-30. Moving the maximum beyond 50 would have
resulted in waste of memory allocated but would have not yield any quantitative difference. However,
setting the maximum to 10 would have truncated the stick-breaking procedure too soon and would have
resulted in a loss of performance. To avoid this situation, we recommend monitoring if the threshold
is met. If not, then increasing the maximum would be needed.
